# Integer Overflow in Julia
This repository demonstrates a potential integer overflow issue in Julia when using the exponentiation operator (`^`) with large integers.  The example function `my_function` squares its input, but for sufficiently large integers, this can result in an overflow, leading to incorrect or unexpected results.
The solution showcases ways to mitigate this risk, including using arbitrary-precision integers from the `BigInt` type.
